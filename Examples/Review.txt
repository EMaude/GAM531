Practical Final(Thursday) - Texture, Lighting, Particals

Theory Final (Wednesday) 12th:

Structure of OpenGL
- display function
- idle
- keyboard & mouse
- main

Linear Transform
- Point 3D
- Vector
- Rotation
- Translation
- Scale

Intro To 3D graphics
-!! Rendering (3D to 2D projection)
-!! Rendering Pipeline (Vertex Shader,(optional)Geometry Shader, Fragment Shader)
- Graphics Card driver compiles shaders


Developing 3D App
- Setup Pipeline
- Setup Geometry
- Setup Transformation
- Push the "render" button glDrawArrays();

Texture Mapping (not on theory exam)
- Dice Lab
- Load Texture into VRAM
- Set Texture Parameters
- Set the active texture
- Apply the texture geometry ( fragment shader )

Game Engine Intro
- Structure
- Scene Graph - tree of scene nodes
- Scene Node
	- transformation
	- mesh 
	- children
	- Render() - make sure you understand this for the theory exam

Light (Phong Model)
- Ambiant
- Diffuse
	- Positional (Implemented in shaders, but not talked about)
	- Directional
- Specular - Glaze
